Alteration of treatment</p>

The lack of power alters the way a person is treated. There have been many instances in history where people who were regarded as ‘low class’ were not seen in the same eye as those who were  powerful. Segregation and discrimination is a prime example. During the industrial era, people were brought over to the United States as slaves from places like Africa and parts of Asia to provide for the high demand of physical labor. Due to their type of work and skin color, which was not in the ordinary, they were not given the same rights and power as the Americans and Europeans. Light skinned people were seen as powerful and superior to colored. Even after the American Civil War, when slaves were freed, there was still a sense of distinction between white and colored people. Segregation laws called Jim Crow laws were set up to enforce segregation. These laws stressed the idea of separate but equal; however this was not true. Colored people would have things of the worst quality and condition, and because of their lack of power they would not be able to do anything about it. If they did not stay at their designated places, they would be punished and put in jail. One famous case was Plessy vs Ferguson. Homer Plessy was an African American who was travelling on a train. Instead of sitting in a car designated for colored people, he sat in the white only car. As a result, he was detained and put on a criminal trial. This was not the only case about segregation. Another famous case was the Brown vs Board of education. This case was about an African American named Oliver Brown who tried to register his daughter to an all white school. Due to her skin color, she was denied admission and was told to return to the all black school. The school for the colored was a mile away where she had to walk six blocks across railroads to get to her bus stop. The white only school was only seven blocks from her house and was in better condition than the black school.  Schools for colored kids were inferior in many aspects. They were in broken down buildings with no heating or plumbing, the classes were overcrowded and teaching material was in short supply. Tupac in his songs says “I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black”. It was evident that those who were powerless and inferior were not treated with compassion and care. </p>
