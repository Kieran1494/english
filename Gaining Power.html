Alteration of Treatment</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The lack of power alters the way a person is treated. There have been many instances in history where people who were regarded as ‘low class’ were not seen in the same eye as those who were  powerful. Segregation and discrimination is a prime example. During the industrial era, people were brought over to the United States as slaves from places like Africa and parts of Asia to provide for the high demand of physical labor. Due to their type of work and skin color, which was not in the ordinary, they were not given the same rights and power as the Americans and Europeans. Light skinned people were seen as powerful and superior to colored. Even after the American Civil War, when slaves were freed, there was still a sense of distinction between white and colored people. Segregation laws called Jim Crow laws were set up to enforce segregation. These laws stressed the idea of separate but equal; however this was not true. Colored people would have things of the worst quality and condition, and because of their lack of power they would not be able to do anything about it. If they did not stay at their designated places, they would be punished and put in jail. One famous case was Plessy vs Ferguson. Homer Plessy was an African American who was travelling on a train. Instead of sitting in a car designated for colored people, he sat in the white only car. As a result, he was detained and put on a criminal trial. This was not the only case about segregation. Another famous case was the Brown vs Board of education. This case was about an African American named Oliver Brown who tried to register his daughter to an all white school. Due to her skin color, she was denied admission and was told to return to the all black school. The school for the colored was a mile away where she had to walk six blocks across railroads to get to her bus stop. The white only school was only seven blocks from her house and was in better condition than the black school.  Schools for colored kids were inferior in many aspects. They were in broken down buildings with no heating or plumbing, the classes were overcrowded and teaching material was in short supply. Tupac in his songs says “I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black”. It was evident that those who were powerless and inferior were not treated with compassion and care. </p>

Incitement of Dehumanization and Inferiority</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The absence of power affects a person as it triggers a feeling of dehumanization an inferiority. Power is something that is in the human nature. A person feels pleasured when they are able to control their environment and their personal self.  When that authority is taken away and someone is given the control over another individual, that individual is inclined to feel less human. An experiment was conducted to test whether powerlessness would insight a feeling of self-dehumanization. A group of about 90 people were divided into two and assigned a role of leader or subordinate which represented high and low power. They were then put in pairs of one leader and one subordinate and each pair was assigned a task of building a Tangram out of legos. They were told that the leader had complete control over the whole process and the subordinate had to oblige to the leader regardless of their own will. Also the leader would be able to submit an evaluation of the subordinate which could not be seen by the subordinate.  In the end, both the leader (powerful) and the subordinate (powerless) were given a survey in which they were given 5 positive traits such as friendly and helpful, and five negative traits like jealous and shy and were to choose those traits which described them at the moment. This information would model how a person feels when they do and dont have power. .They were also asked to write about how they thought the other participant saw them. The results indicated that the people who were powerless had the negative traits and felt that they were not treated like a human. When someone is not treated equally or is not given power over themselves, they feel inferior. This feeling can lead into the inferiority complex. The inferiority complex makes an individual feel worthless and embeds a sense of hopelessness. If the inferiority complex lasts for a long period of time, it might give way to something called the superiority complex. The superiority complex is that a when a person feels that the only way to get rid of their inferiorness is to make others feel inferior. An example is bullying; usually bullies are those that have been bullied themselves. To relieve them of this bullying, they start doing it to others. This makes the person feel as if they are now superior. It is clear that when a person does not have much power and influence, they can perceive themselves as lower than others and feel dehumanized.</font>
