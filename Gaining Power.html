No Man Rules Alone</p>

One Person cannot build a society, be the army, and make the food. The people below must be controlled. The way to do this is to control the wealth of the nation and give it to the important individuals, the keys to power.

Dictatorships vs Democracy</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The “key to power” determines what type of government any nation has. For dictatorships, this means natural resources. An example of this dynamic is, according to Saudi Facts and Statistics oil was the largest source of wealth in Saudi Arabia which explains why it is a kingdom. This contrasts with Norway another oil rich nation whose oil only makes up ~25% which is why it is a democracy. “Rules for Rulers” also goes into detail about this dynamic saying rather cynically, “A gold mine can run with dying slaves and still produce great treasure.” This natural resource removes the need for citizen involvement allowing a dictator to cut them out and not spend any money on the people. A counter argument to this would be that a study has shown that dictators are averse to inequality but according to this it should be the opposite because the dictators should only spend as much as needed on the people which should decrease as they get poorer. This however may be true for general human behavior but the people who act this way are not successful. They may come to power but will then later be deposed. The successful rulers are lacking this trait that most seem to have. To ensure a secure passage of the source of wealth dynasties are created to prevent instability when it seems the ruler may die soon.</font>

Incitement of Dehumanization and Inferiority</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The absence of power affects a person as it triggers a feeling of dehumanization an inferiority. Power is something that is in the human nature. A person feels pleasured when they are able to control their environment and their personal self.  When that authority is taken away and someone is given the control over another individual, that individual is inclined to feel less human. An experiment was conducted to test whether powerlessness would insight a feeling of self-dehumanization. A group of about 90 people were divided into two and assigned a role of leader or subordinate which represented high and low power. They were then put in pairs of one leader and one subordinate and each pair was assigned a task of building a Tangram out of legos. They were told that the leader had complete control over the whole process and the subordinate had to oblige to the leader regardless of their own will. Also the leader would be able to submit an evaluation of the subordinate which could not be seen by the subordinate.  In the end, both the leader (powerful) and the subordinate (powerless) were given a survey in which they were given 5 positive traits such as friendly and helpful, and five negative traits like jealous and shy and were to choose those traits which described them at the moment. This information would model how a person feels when they do and dont have power. .They were also asked to write about how they thought the other participant saw them. The results indicated that the people who were powerless had the negative traits and felt that they were not treated like a human. When someone is not treated equally or is not given power over themselves, they feel inferior. This feeling can lead into the inferiority complex. The inferiority complex makes an individual feel worthless and embeds a sense of hopelessness. If the inferiority complex lasts for a long period of time, it might give way to something called the superiority complex. The superiority complex is that a when a person feels that the only way to get rid of their inferiorness is to make others feel inferior. An example is bullying; usually bullies are those that have been bullied themselves. To relieve them of this bullying, they start doing it to others. This makes the person feel as if they are now superior. It is clear that when a person does not have much power and influence, they can perceive themselves as lower than others and feel dehumanized.</p></font>

Struggle for Acquiring Power </p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The deficiency of power in a person triggers a need for action. When a person does not have what they want, they carry out some action or movement to make it known to others. For example, when a little child wants a lollipop from the candy store and his parents refuse, he cries. History has been proof to this point. There have been many revolutions carried out around the world as a result of people not been given what they desire. One example is the American Revolution which led to the revolutionary war; one of the major causes of this was that the colonists did not have power to vote for parliament. Since Britain controlled the new world, lawmakers in Britain were the ones who elected parliament members for the colonists. This lack of power upset the colonists as they felt that the British lawmakers did not understand the condition and needs of the colonists since they were not living there. As a result, the colonists decided to start a revolution which was led by George Washington and some others. However, the actions taken as a response to powerlessness was violent. The American Revolution consisted of many wars where many people lost their lives to become independent and have their own power. Another famous revolution was the Latin American Revolution. This revolution was similar to the American revolution in that there was also a group which had an absence of power. The Creoles who were Latin American born, were not seen in the same eye as the Peninsulares who were Spanish-American. Since Spain had the control over Latin America, those who were born there were superior and more powerful. Only the Peninsulares could hold high offices in the colonial government, and the creoles could become officers of the army. Due to the frustration of the lack of representation and power, the Creoles rebelled and fought against the Peninsulares to gain their power. Power is something that is in the human disposition, and when it is lost or is absent, people will take action to acquire it.</p></font>
