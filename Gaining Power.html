One Person cannot build a society, be the army, and make the food. The people below must be controlled. The way to do this is to control the wealth of the nation and give it to the important individuals, the keys to power.

Dictatorships vs Democracy</p>
	</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The “key to power” determines what type of government any nation has. For dictatorships, this means natural resources. An example of this dynamic is, according to Saudi Facts and Statistics oil was the largest source of wealth in Saudi Arabia which explains why it is a kingdom. This contrasts with Norway another oil rich nation whose oil only makes up ~25% which is why it is a democracy. “Rules for Rulers” also goes into detail about this dynamic saying rather cynically, “A gold mine can run with dying slaves and still produce great treasure.” This natural resource removes the need for citizen involvement allowing a dictator to cut them out and not spend any money on the people. A counter argument to this would be that a study has shown that dictators are averse to inequality but according to this it should be the opposite because the dictators should only spend as much as needed on the people which should decrease as they get poorer. This however may be true for general human behavior but the people who act this way are not successful. They may come to power but will then later be deposed. The successful rulers are lacking this trait that most seem to have. To ensure a secure passage of the source of wealth dynasties are created to prevent instability when it seems the ruler may die soon.</font>

Dynasties</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
Dynasties are a way to keep the keys happy. If there is no clear heir, then there will be a succession crisis which is a risk for all the key supporters because they might not be a key in the new regime. The keys might dispose the current ruler to make sure that they keep their positions of power. However, with a clear heir all the keys know exactly who will come to power next making them less likely to mutiny. This is why all absolute rulers have clear lines of succession. A good example of this is the brothers Gracchi. When Tiberius was killed all his key supporters moved to his brother Gaius. This allowed the keys to not worry if Tiberius was killed and thus stuck with him. The same rules of monarchies also apply to democracies. The previous example was from the roman republic not the empire. The US has clear succession from president to vice president and so on. The US also has a history of political dynasties for the same reason dictators do to prevent instability and worried supporters. The Bushes are a good example of this. Dynasties apply to all government forms, keep the keys happy, and keeps stability. Dynasties will always exist lest there be instability.<p style="text-align:center;"</p>

<p>Changing Government Types</p>
</font>
<font size="5">
<p>
The government type changes as the source of wealth changes. For example, Rome went from a land based agricultural kingdom to a merchant and craftsmen republic and then to an agriculture and mining based empire. Even if the government type doesn’t change more freedoms will have to be given to people until the government type changes. The modern European monarchies like Scandinavia and the UK had this happen. A slow and gradual change from a monarchy to a democracy as the wealth of the people surpassed the wealth of the natural resources. Saudi Arabia’s economy is becoming less and less based on oil which would explain the increase in personal freedoms recently. This also explains why democracies set up in oil, gold, or diamond rich nations almost always quickly switch to a dictatorship. The people don’t produce enough wealth so they are irrelevant to keeping and gaining power resulting in the quick change back to a dictatorship.
